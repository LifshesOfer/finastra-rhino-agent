_**Rhino Test Case**_ is the basic entity for invoking an automation. Each _**Rhino Test Case**_ contains one or more _**Rhino Test Step**_. Rhino holds test cases under _**Test Collection**_ which is the equivalent of test set or test group/category. A tests collection can hold zero (an empty collection) or more test cases.

> _**Information**_
>  
> 1. It is possible to add _**Rhino Test Case**_ to multiple collections.
> 2. It is possible to associate _**Test Collection**_ with multiple configurations.  

Use the following API methods to request details about _**Rhino Test Cases**_ and to create or modify them.

## Get Tests Collections
Returns a list of available _**Rhino Test Cases**_ collections.

```
GET /api/v3/tests
```

#### Response Content
```js
{
  "collection": [
    {
      "id": "1ed4ea1c-9959-40d7-b40e-717b8fc1cfb4",
      "configurations": [
        "03d1cd94-5e38-43d8-b010-e932d92f9067",
