> IIS configuration and website security involve concepts that aren't covered by this tutorial. Consult the IIS guidance in the [Microsoft IIS documentation](https://www.iis.net/) and the [ASP.NET Core article on hosting with IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/?view=aspnetcore-5.0) before hosting production apps on IIS.

## Supported OS
The following operating systems are supported:  

* Windows 7 or later
* Windows Server 2012 R2 or later  

Apps published for 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) deployment are supported. Deploy a 32-bit app with a 32-bit (x86) .NET Core SDK unless the app:  

* Requires the larger virtual memory address space available to a 64-bit app.
* Requires the larger IIS stack size.
* Has 64-bit native dependencies.

## Prerequisites
* .NET Core SDK installed on the development machine.
* Windows Server configured with the Web Server (IIS) server role. If your server isn't configured to host websites with IIS, follow the guidance in the IIS configuration section of the [Host ASP.NET Core on Windows with IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/?view=aspnetcore-5.0#iis-configuration) article and then return to this tutorial.

## Install the .NET Core Hosting Bundle on Windows Server
Install the _**.NET Core Hosting Bundle**_ on the IIS server. The bundle installs the .NET Core Runtime, .NET Core Library, and the [ASP.NET Core Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module?view=aspnetcore-5.0). The module allows ASP.NET Core apps to run behind IIS.

Download the installer using the following link:  
[Current .NET Core Hosting Bundle installer (direct download)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/permalink/dotnetcore-current-windows-runtime-bundle-installer)  

1. Run the installer on the IIS server.
2. Restart the server or execute ```net stop was /y``` followed by ```net start w3svc``` in a command shell.

## Create an IIS site in IIS Manager

2. Extract the files into ```C:\Rhino.Agent``` folder (make sure the files are extract and you don't have a folder inside a folder).
3. Open a command line as an administrator.
4. Type in the command ```%windir%\system32\inetsrv\InetMgr.exe```.
