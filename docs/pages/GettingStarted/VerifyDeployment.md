> This is an optional process and can be skipped if you already know that Rhino is correctly deployed.
> Some of the tests requires a connection to the outside world. If you are running in an isolated environment without connection, these tests will fail but if all other tests have passed, you can ignore these failed tests.

## Supported OS
> Rhino API runs on the latest .NET Core version.  

Please read [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) for OS support matrix.

## Requirements
1. Rhino Server up and running. Please explore the different deployment sections for more information of how to deploy Rhino Server.
