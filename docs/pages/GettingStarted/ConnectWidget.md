Rhino Widget is a **[Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) Exploratory Testing Tool** that works seamlessly integrated with Rhino actions repository and connectors.
It allows users to define exploratory testing scenarios, record and manipulate actions, set expected results, playback the recorded tests, automatically create tests using the different connectors and more.
It works integrated with Rhino Server Recorder, but can also be used in a standalone mode (directly from Rhino Server).
